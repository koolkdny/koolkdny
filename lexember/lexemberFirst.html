    "Important"
</div>
<div class = "lexemberMenu", style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 2%;">
    &emsp;On the surface, the word "important" has nothing to do with the prompt of <span style="color:pink; font-size:1.1em; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span>,
    but in Pakozean, my conlang, specifically, it has an interesting feature that warrants its relation to the number three.
</div> 
<div class = "lexemberMenu", style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 2%;">
    &emsp;Pakozean has <span style="color:pink; font-size:1.1em; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">three</span> different words that all roughly translate to "important,"
    but also retain their own subtle nuances, setting them apart from eachother.

    <span style="font-size:5vw">1. <span style="font-style: italic;">todoejane</span></span>
    <br>
    /t&#688;o.do.e.ja.ne/
    <br>
    &emsp;The word "todoejane" describes a sort of importance that stems from pure emotional attachment, in isolation from its affect on the ("subject" referring to the person who the importance pertains to.). It describes an 
    abitrary attachment to something. For example, a person may find themselves attached to a certain pen, not because of any positive or negative memories associated with
    its use, but rather simply because it has been used so much. This kind of importance is described by the word "todoejane."
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:1.5em;">Etymology:</span>
    &emsp;The etymology of todoejane is very simple. It comes from the root words "todoe" (heart, feeling),  and "jane" (to squeeze, to hug). it retains the conjugations of "jane",
    because Pakozean adjectives are actually all stative verbs in disguise.

    <span style="font-size:5vw">2. <span style="font-style: italic;">pakkue</span></span>
    <br>
    /p&#688;a.k&#720;&#688;&#623;.e/
    <br>
    &emsp;"Pakkue" describes a kind of importance that is defined by an active positive impact on the subject.
    An example of this might be estrogen. Estrogen is very important to me because it would have a very positive impact 
    on my life. Note that I said would be, (&#128532;) because the positive effect can be merely theoretical, and the word would still be
    used correctly (in case you hadn't already assumed so). This also applies to the other words.
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:1.5em;">Etymology:</span>
    &emsp;Pakkue comes from two words, "pako" (love), and "kue" (to do). Over time, people talking quickly made the "o" between the two words disappear, 
    leaving the word "pakkue". The etymological meaning could be interpreted as being loved by the object of the importance, but in the end the "to do" is 
    merely because Pakozean adjectives are stative verbs.

<div class = "lexemberMenu", style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 2%;">
    <span style="font-size:5vw">3. <span style="font-style: italic;">den&#275; kue</span></span>
    <br>
    /de.ne&#720; k&#623;.e/
    <br>
    &emsp;The final word for "important" is the opposite of Pakkue; A kind of importance defined by a negative impact on the subject.
    My example here will be, as den&#275; kue is the opposite of pakkue, the opposite of estrogen: testosterone. My mortal enemy. In a way,
    testosterone is important to me. It is important because it effects me quite significantly when it's in my blood and I hate it. I think that
    den&#275; kue is my favorite of these three words, because I think this view of the idea of importance is less common, and gives the word a unique quality, which carries
    over to the whole conculture that Pakozean is a part of.
    <br>
    <span style="font-size:1.5em;">Etymology:</span>
    &emsp;Den&#275; kue's etymology obviously also involves the word "kue" (to do). I'll be honest, I've kinda lost track of the "den&#275;" part's etymology. I don't think it's its own 
    root word, so my guess is that it stems from "ide" (to exist), and "n&#275;" (negative suffix). I don't know where the "i" at the beginning of "ide" went.
